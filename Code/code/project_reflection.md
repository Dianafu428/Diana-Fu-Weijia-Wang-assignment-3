# Project Writeup and Reflection

## Project Overview

- In this assignment, our goal is to create a tool that allows the user to input an Boston address and the tool would take the address name and return the closest MBTA stop in 5 miles. We prepare meta_helper to gather information from MBTA, finds a place's latitude and longitude, and returns the nearest MBTA stop and whether it is wheelchair accessible. We also use *flask* to design a web page that would ask for a place name and display all the returned results. The website would display *the nearest stop does not exist in 5 miles* if there is no stop in 5 miles. The website would display an error page and a link that will redirect the user back to the home page.
